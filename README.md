## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of a car based on various attributes. This can be useful for car dealers, buyers, and sellers to estimate the market value of used vehicles.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selection and transformation of relevant features.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and training machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.
- **Prediction**: Predicting car prices based on the trained model.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohancanish/CAR_PRICE_Predictor_With_ML.git
cd CAR_PRICE_Predictor_With_ML
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can start experimenting with the project.

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean the dataset using the provided scripts.
2. **Model Training**: Train the model using different algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model performance using the test data.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict car prices.

To run the project, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features such as car model, year of manufacture, mileage, etc. Make sure to preprocess the dataset before feeding it into the model.

## Model Training

The project involves training multiple machine learning models to predict car prices. You can experiment with different models and tune hyperparameters for better performance.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics. The results will help you choose the best model for prediction.
